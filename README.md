# Title: Emulating a Classic Toy with a Web App

## Description:

The project titled "Emulating a Classic Toy with a Web App" is an interactive web application that replicates the user experience of the iconic children's toy, the MattelÂ® 'See 'N' Say Storymaker'. The web app allows users to create random stories by selecting phrases from predefined arrays of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and settings.

## Features:

Users interact with the web app by clicking buttons to select random phrases from designated arrays.
The phrases are concatenated to form a text string, simulating the creation of a story.
The built-in TextToSpeech API reads the generated story aloud (supported in most browsers except MSIE).
The interface provides buttons for generating random stories with a single click and a reset button for creating new stories.
The project includes well-commented, formatted, and organized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to ensure clarity and maintainability.
The web app is hosted on a web server, providing accessibility and convenience for users.
